3. Run the program using: ./a.out

Use prompted inputs:
4. Input the number of recorded coordinates

Greedy Algorithm - Algorithm 2
Execution of Algorithm.
Step 1: Clone/Download the files into a folder.
Step 2: Compile the code by using command "g++ main.cpp"
Step 3: Test Compiler using command "./a.exe"

While Testing:
Step 4: Input a starting city # from 1 to 5
Note: All valid input should be able to traverse back to itself.
